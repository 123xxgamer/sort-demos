# Sorting Algorithms Demos
I was interested in learning more about different sorting algorithms and I saw a couple simulations that already exist, so I decided to make my own!
Demo: https://youtu.be/wsJbbNoTaGg

### Controls:
- space to pause/unpause sort
- right arrow to sort one step
- up/down arrows to change amount of data by 20
- m to play sound
- 1, 2, 3, to change step sorting algorithms
- q, d, a to reset in different ways
- b, s, i to full sort using different algorithms
